# Bootstrap the development environment - add extra files needed to run configure. 
# Note autoreconf should do what this file achieves, but it has a bug when working with automake!
# The latest config.guess and config.sub should be copied into Tools/config.
# This script will ensure the latest is copied from your autotool installation.
